        <p>
            I studied Human Factors Engineering at Arizona State University (ASU), where I developed a strong foundation in designing user-centered systems that enhance safety, usability, and performance. My coursework included topics such as cognitive ergonomics, usability testing, human-computer interaction, and systems engineering.
